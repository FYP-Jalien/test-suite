Running strucutre is as follows.

You cannot run scripts one by one.
Use index.sh at root to run scripts.
It will index.sh scripts in sub folders to run the whole tests.
This approach was taken because to avoid errors due to script import paths.
FYI, flagged approach will be deployed to run tests customizedly usin the root index.sh

func folder has scripts for fucntions which are being used commonly.
    messages-->print_full_test will be used to output test execution result. Please ue only that to display test results.
